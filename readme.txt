This plugin adds an onscreen keyboard powered by Javascript/JQuery to your page on demand.

== Description ==

This plugin adds an onscreen keyboard powered by Javascript/JQuery, ported from Samuel Deering's work on github with his permission under the above licence by Iain Redmill, now working within WordPress, allowing mouse based input or input when working from a touch screen device. Keyboard settings etc can be modified by editing the file. To add a keyboard, enter [oskb] within your page where you wish it to appear.

Apart from improving the working of the older version, the on-screen keyboard for password protected posts and pages in different flavors has been added recently.
Onscreen keyboard for password protected posts and pages. Standard keyboard can still be used.
Onscreen numerical keyboard for password protected posts and pages where password is numerical i.e. a pincode. Furthermore: 12 digit password is submitted automatically.  (Passwords longer than 12 characters, of which the first 12 characters are numbers, are therefore impossible.) Standard keyboard can still be used. General passwords can still be used by using standard keyboard.
